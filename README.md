A professional medical imaging application designed for the automated detection of bone abnormalities (fractures) in X-ray images. The system features a modern Django-based web dashboard and a React Native mobile application, powered by a state-of-the-art YOLOv8 object detection model.

## 🌟 Features

- **High-Accuracy Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv8 for precise identification and localization of bone fractures.
- **Modern Web Dashboard**: Professional "Medical Glassmorphism" UI for easy case management and analysis.
- **Mobile Integration**: Dedicated React Native app for on-the-go diagnostic reviews.
- **Diagnostic History**: Persistent storage of detection results with clinical reporting features.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Interactive previews and visual feedback during model inference.
- **Export Capabilities**: Generate PDF reports for clinical documentation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Django, Django REST Framework
- **Frontend**: Vanilla CSS (Modern UI Design), React Native (Mobile)
- **AI/ML**: YOLOv8 (Ultralytics), PyTorch, OpenCV
- **Database**: SQLite (Default) / PostgreSQL (Recommended for production)

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js & npm (for mobile app)
- Virtual Environment (recommended)

### Backend Setup
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Apply migrations**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Run the server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### Mobile App Setup
1. Navigate to the mobile app directory:
   ```bash
   cd BoneMobileApp
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   npx react-native run-android # or run-ios
   ```
